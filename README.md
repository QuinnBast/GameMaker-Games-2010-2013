# GameMaker Games
Various games that I had created using Game Maker throughout highschool. All graphics were created by myself. Information about the details of each game and my key learning takeaways are listed below. If you play any of the games I suggest at least playing "Push", as it is my most complete game with many different features. "Water the Grass" is also reccommended as it is a game that I wish I had the time to complete but the progress was going very smoothly until I stopped working on it. "Tower Defence" is the 3rd best while the others were mostly experimental.

# Games (In order of creation)
- ### French Number Generator (April 2010)
  - #### Description:
    - A number generator that selects a random number from 0-100. This program was created for my 9th Grade French class in order for us to learn numbers in French. We used the program to play Bingo.

  - #### Takeaways:
    - Understanding of Game Maker Language and concepts including:
      - Sprites
      - Objects
      - Rooms
      - Events
- ### Tower Defence (August 2011-2012)
  - #### Description:
    - 	A basic tower defence game with various towers to place on the map. Two levels, a menu system, and local profile system were implemented. This is the first game I truly "made" myself to a somewhat completed state.

  - #### Takeaways:
    - Pixel Art and Sprites
    - Object Pathing
    - Introduction to UI
    - Local file saves and profile systems
- ### Push (January 2012-November 2012)
  - #### Description:
    - A strategy game that requires the player to push similar blocks together. Many levels (46!) and multiple worlds make this game my largest game with GameMaker. With music and graphics that were all created by myself, I consider this game one of my favorites as this is my most complete game that I have created in Game Maker.

  - #### Takeaways:
    - Audio creation and implementation.
    - Graphics, Animations, and Pixel Art.
    - Increased experience with UI.
    - Creation of tutorials and message boxes to guide users.
- Trench Warfare (December 2012)
  - #### Description:
    - A buggy but interesting game where I attempted to implement path finding and AI controls with units. Initial pathfinding worked well and units traveled to the front line, however units would not return to ammo crates when out of ammo. The game was intended to be used as a military simulator where units could be hired, selected and commanded to push into and defeat the enemy units.
    - This project was abandoned during its development.
  - #### Screenshots:
  - #### Takeaways:
    - Minimal AI pathfinding
    - Non-grid based collisions
- Test Weaponry Game (January 2013)
  - #### Description:
    - This was a test simulation where I was testing different projectiles and types of bullets that could be created in Game Maker.
    - Controls: Arrow keys move the player, left click fires a machine gun, right click fires a laser
  - #### Screenshots:
  - #### Takeaways:
    - Not many honestly.
- Bullet Masters (March 2013)
  - #### Description:
    - A continuation to the test weaponry simulation game above. Again implementing AI units and pathfinding, enemys spawn and follow the player attempting to collide into the player.
    - Controls: Arrow keys to move, left click to shoot, and scroll wheel to cycle through the various weapons avaliable.
  - #### Screenshots:
  - #### Takeaways:
    - AI pathfinding
    - Terrain and collisions
    - Various weaponry tricks
- Water the Grass (Mid-Late 2013)
  - #### Description:
    - This is a gem that I wish I had more time to work on. By placing sprinklers on the lawn, the objective is to water the grass and not let your grass die. Unfortunately, development was cut short due to graduating High School. However, I had made extensive plans for this game. Multiple pages of ideas had plans for brids, worms, animals, and pedestrians around the lawn as well as various locations for the lawn and an upgrade system. This would have made a really fun game to play if I had the time to complete. The gameplay is extremely smooth as learning from my past games I knew what to avoid/use when creating the systems in this game. This game also includes my first attempt at creating a pop-up user interface which was extremely fun to implement. I wish I had spent more time on this project and wish I could create a final product.
  - #### Screenshots:
  - #### Takeaways:
    - Extremely smooth interface compared to my previous games.
    - Much better graphics after learning 'pillow shading'
    - Very smooth User-Interface
