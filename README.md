# GameMaker-Games-2012
Various games that I had created using Game Maker throughout highschool

#Games (In order of creation)
- French Number Generator
	A number generator that selected numbers from 0-100. This was created for my 9th Grade French class for us to play Bingo with.
- Tower Defence
	One of my first games that was somewhat complete. Two levels and a profile system were implemented to save player data locally when playing. The first game I truly "made"
- Push
	A strategy game that requires the play to push similar blocks together. Many levels and multiple worlds make this game my largest game with GameMaker.
	With music and graphics taht were all created by myself, I consider this game one of my favorites as everything was created myself and I was able to experience all aspects of Game Design.
- Trench Warfare
	A buggy but interesting game where I attempted to implement path finding and AI controls with units. Units would not return to ammo crates when out of ammo but the game had a good concept.
	This project was abandoned during its development
- Test Weaponry Game
	This was a test simulation where I was testing different projectiles and types of bullets that could be created in Game Maker
	Controls: Arrow keys move the player, left click fires one weapon, right click fires a laser
- Bullet Masters
	A continuation to the test weaponry simulation game. Again implementing AI units and pathfinding, enemys spawn and follow the player attempting to collide into the player.
	Controls: Arrow keys to move, left click to shoot, and scroll wheel to cycle through the various weapons avaliable.
	Learning points: Mouse controles, AI pathfinding, Terrain and collisions, Various weaponry tricks
- Water the Grass
	This is a gem that I wish I had more time to work on. By placing sprinklers on the lawn, the objective is to water the grass and not let your grass die.
	Unfortunately, development was cut short, however, plans for brids, worms, animals, and pedestrians around the lawn as well as various locations for the lawn would have made this a really fun game to play.
	The gameplay is extremely smooth as learning from my past games I knew what to avoid/use when creating the systems in this game.
	This game also includes my first attemot at creating a pop-up user interface which was extremely fun to implement. Although no items appeared in the menu due to lack of time for the project, adding items to the menu was quite simple.
	I wish I had spent more time on this project and wish I could create a final product.
